        <marquee> <h2>Welcome to Disaster Managment</h2> </marquee>
        <p>Natural and man-made disasters have the potential to cause immense devastation to communities and economies worldwide. Effective disaster management is critical to mitigate the impact of these events, save lives, and facilitate a swift recovery.
            <p>Over the last decade and a half, the globe has been witnessing frequent occurrence of such extreme disasters as hurricanes, earthquakes, bush fires and outbreaks.</p>
            <p> This provides a basis for robust and flexible disaster management systems. However, traditional methods that depend on manual systems and segmented information mechanisms have not been effective enough for the dynamic and intricate nature of contemporary events.Resilient and sustainable communities rely heavily on disaster management as a vital area that ensures they do not fall victim to either artificial or natural disasters. </p>
            Increasing incidence and magnitude of disasters around the world reinforce the need for viable readiness, response, and recuperation.</p>

            <p> <b>1.Evaluation of Disaster Management Frameworks:</b> The nature of disasters dictates that over the years, disaster management has changed. It has shifted to a strategy of preemption in contrast to most strategy that directed at reaction to other strategy. The research focuses on integration of preparation, response and recovery phases in community based approaches in literature.</p>

            <p> <b>2.Community Resilience:</b> Community resilience as a theme concept in disaster management literature is examined. Some scholars believe that the best prevention measure against disasters is developing a resistant community. In the community resilience studies, the concepts they explore include social cohesion, community adaptive capacity, as well as local leadership. It is essential to identify what makes communities strong in surviving through disasters.</p>

            </div>
            <p> <b>3.Role of Technology in Disaster Response:</b> Disaster response has greatly been revolutionized by advancements in technology.Some literature shows the growing use of artificial intelligence, remotes sensing, and communications technology in emergency management. These innovations are crucial for improving early warnings, management of resources, and coordinating responses across different agencies. Nevertheless, issues including accessibility, equity, and ethical issues are also discussed in these conversations, warranting some equilibrium when integrating these technologies in teaching. </p>

            <p> <b>4.Psychological and Social Impacts: </b>Apart from physical damage, disasters have strong psychosocial implications in society. The psychological trauma, communities and long-term impact of psychological trauma on communities and long-term impact of psychological trauma on children’s learning are among the various topics covered in the literature. It is essential to comprehend these factors in order to design interventions for both short and long-term effects of individuals and societies.</p>

        </div>
            <p> <b>5.Strengths and Weaknesses of Current Approaches:</b> An evaluation of prior disaster management efforts reveals both positives and negatives. They include early alerts, involvement of the community, and international partnerships; however, there is challenge in funding, poor communications, and recovery efforts after the disaster. The literature review is based on weaknesses in current strategies that open ways for improvement of disaster management efficacy.
                The integrative approach that has employed a summarization, in place of interpolation, provides basis for this study whereby some key points of contention raised in the literature are addressed with reference to the existing knowledge base that may be strengthened and/or new approaches proposed to enhance disaster risk reduction.</p>
